### Description

Converts any color to any format... Thanks to Dan Redding - Blue Knot Software for making the VBColor to RGB code. Please notice me if something is not working. I made this program becouse I was trying to make better GUI's, but none of the default VB Colors was good enough for me. So I used Photoshop to find the color I wanted and then needed something to convert it to VBColor. And since it was pretty simple to make, I made some other convertions as well. As I said earlier, the last one by Dan Redding - Blue Knot Software, was really good. Thanks.
